# Dexa-Python-Assistant
Dexa is a python virtual assistant. It recognizes users speech input and text input and returns  the results as requested by the user.

The scope of this project is to save time for handling
simple calculations, search for information and make
our day-to-day activity easier. In today’s world, no one
has time to spoil, and this project mainly focuses on
those type of people. The project will use python
libraries, Wikipedia library and Wolfram Alpha library
in order to perform tasks specified by the user. It will
also use natural language processing to understand
what the user is saying in their natural language.


The virtual assistant is a GUI (Graphical User
Interface) program which works via:
 Text → It will understand the written text/chat
given by the user to the program and produce
the suitable output.
 Voice → It will understand the basic words such
as “Who is …”, “What is …” spoken by the user
and provides output accordingly.

As mentioned above, the virtual assistant will use
natural language processing (NLP) to process the user’s
text or voice.
